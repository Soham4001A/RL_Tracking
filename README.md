Here’s a detailed README.md file for your project based on the work you’ve done so far.

Object Tracking RL with PPO and Terrain Awareness

This project focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent (referred to as a CCA) to track and intercept a moving target (Foxtrot) in a 3D environment with dynamic terrain. The primary objective is to build an intelligent system capable of handling complex scenarios, including varying terrains, dynamic obstacles, and multi-agent interactions. (NOTE: the latest implementation is PPO_V2)

Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to train agents to:
	•	Track and intercept a moving target (Foxtrot) in a 3D space.
	•	Navigate dynamic terrains while avoiding collisions.
	•	Balance multiple objectives, such as energy efficiency, collision avoidance, and exploration.

Key Components
	•	Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): The RL algorithm used to train the agents.
	•	Custom Gym Environment: A tailored environment integrating terrain maps, multi-agent dynamics, and customizable objectives.
	•	Terrain Integration: A realistic terrain system where agents must navigate based on local terrain maps.
	•	Reward Shaping: A potential-based reward system that balances progress, energy efficiency, and collision penalties.

Features
	1.	Dynamic Terrain:
	•	Local 5×5×3 terrain maps are included in the agent’s observations.
	•	Agents must avoid terrain collisions.
	•	Terrain-aware reward system.
	2.	Multi-Agent Interaction:
	•	Support for multiple CCAs tracking a single Foxtrot.
	•	Flexible action and observation spaces to accommodate multi-agent dynamics.
	3.	Advanced Reward Shaping:
	•	Potential-based reward shaping to encourage efficient tracking.
	•	Terrain collision penalties to promote safe navigation.
	4.	Curriculum Learning:
	•	Gradual complexity increase during training.
	•	Includes scenarios with stationary targets, dynamic targets, and randomized spawning.
	5.	Custom PPO Implementation:
	•	Transformer-based feature extractor for complex observation spaces.
	•	Tunable hyperparameters for flexible experimentation.

Environment

Action Space
	•	A continuous action space representing movement in the 3D grid.
	•	(num_cca, 3) shape where each CCA can move in x, y, and z directions.

Observation Space
	•	Includes:
	•	CCA positions and actions over the last 6 timesteps.
	•	Local terrain maps (5×5×3 grid) for the current and past 6 timesteps.
	•	Foxtrot’s position history.
	•	Shape is dynamically adjusted based on the number of CCAs.

Reward Function
	•	Encourages:
	•	Closing the distance to the target.
	•	Energy-efficient movements.
	•	Avoiding collisions with terrain and other agents.
	•	Exploring the environment.
	•	Uses potential-based shaping for smooth learning.

Setup and Installation

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ObjectTrackingRL.git
cd ObjectTrackingRL


	2.	Install dependencies: (sorry this doesn't exist yet)

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set up global flags in globals.py to customize training.

Usage

Run Training
	1.	Launch the training script:

python simulation.py


	2.	Modify curriculum learning flags to start with different scenarios.

Resume Training
	•	To resume training, load the saved model and normalization settings:

model = PPO.load("./PPO_V2/Trained_Model")
vec_env = VecNormalize.load("./PPO_V2/Trained_VecNormalize.pkl", env)



Visualization
	•	A 3D visualization can be implemented to view the agent’s progress and behavior during training.

Curriculum Learning

Training follows a gradual increase in complexity:
	1.	Stationary Foxtrot: Fixed target and basic terrain.
	2.	Randomized Foxtrot Position: Adds variability in target spawning.
	3.	Dynamic Target (Foxtrot): Foxtrot moves along predefined paths (e.g., rectangular trajectories).
	4.	Multi-Agent Scenarios: Introduces multiple CCAs for tracking a single target.
	5.	Complex Terrain: Adds realistic terrain challenges.

Key Learnings
	•	Patience and iteration are crucial for debugging and understanding ML/RL systems.
	•	Start simple but design scalable infrastructure to handle complex scenarios.
	•	Reward shaping is key to guiding agent behavior effectively.
	•	Innovating and trying new strategies can yield breakthroughs when standard methods fall short.

Future Expansion
	1.	Multi-Agent Collaboration:
	•	Introduce inter-agent communication and cooperative strategies.
	2.	Expand to MultiDiscrete Action Spaces:
	•	Support discrete and hybrid action spaces for more complex tasks.
	3.	Advanced Terrain:
	•	Use real-world terrain data to increase simulation realism.
	4.	Generalization:
	•	Test the model on unseen terrains and target behaviors.
	5.	Advanced Visualization:
	•	Real-time 3D visualization of agents’ trajectories and terrain interaction.

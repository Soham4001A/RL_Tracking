" HERE WE GOOOOO "

EXPANSION TO MULTIDISCRETE -->
1. Ensure that when expanding CCA's - we have correct input shaping -> see o1 suggestion
2. Ensure that when expanding CCA's - Move to MultiDiscrete

PATH FIXING -->
1. Fix Path for Foxtrot -> Kinda Working {1/19/2025}
2. Add random location spawing for CCA's to train -> Done {1/19/2025}
3. Add random location spawing for Foxtrot to train -> Done {1/19/2025}
4. Add random route function picker for Foxtrot at the start of training every episode

PATROL & PROTECT OBJECTIVE -->
1. Start with basic third object tracking & interception

Random location isn't training but setting it to a single point is working with complex reward
